          We take care of all documentation, including the free RC transfer. In case there is any mismatch in RC like signature mismatch, you may need to be present at the RTO. <br/> Some States also require the previous owner to be present at the RTO in order to register the car with the new owner, also known as 'Party Peshi'. A CARS24 representative <br/> will be present with you throughout the process.

          The timeline of the RC transfer might vary depending on the availability of the prospective buyer and the RTO requirements. However, you donâ€™t need to worry about it at all! <br/> All our customers are covered under the CARS24 Seller Protection Policy, which means until the RC transfer of your car is complete, we take full responsibility for the safety  <br/> of your vehicle. Once the ownership has been transferred, we will send you an email with the proof of RC transfer.
